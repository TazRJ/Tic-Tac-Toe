## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project involves the development of the nostalgic childhood game, tic-tac-toe, using vanilla Javascript. The goal of this project was to experiment and develop my personal coding abilty and understanding of javascript. The game is completely functional, aesthetically pleasing and interactable.

For the purpose of the demo, the website is currently hosted on Netlify.

## Optimizations

Incorporating a menu, instructions, and the ability to play against the computer are all fantastic features that can enhance the user experience in future iterations of the Tic-Tac-Toe Showdown Web App:

1. **Menu System:**
   - **Main Menu:** Implement a main menu screen that welcomes players and serves as the central hub of the game. From here, users can navigate to various sections of the app.
   - **Game Modes:** Organize different game modes within the menu, such as Single Player vs. AI, Multiplayer, Leaderboards, and Settings. This simplifies game selection and customization.
   - **Settings:** Include options to adjust audio preferences, graphics settings, theme selection, and language settings for a personalized experience.

2. **Instructions and Tutorials:**
   - **Interactive Tutorials:** Create interactive, step-by-step tutorials or pop-up tooltips that guide new players on how to play the game. Explain the rules, winning conditions, and various strategies.
   - **Practice Mode:** Offer a practice mode where players can experiment with moves and strategies without the pressure of a real match. This can be a valuable learning tool.

3. **Single Player vs. AI:**
   - **Difficulty Levels:** Allow players to choose from multiple AI difficulty levels, catering to both beginners and advanced players. For example, novice, intermediate, and expert AI opponents.
   - **AI Strategy Insights:** Include an option for the AI to provide hints or insights on its moves to help players improve their skills over time.
   - **Stat Tracking:** Keep a record of a player's performance against the AI, including win-loss records and game history for a sense of progression.

4. **Help and Support:**
   - **FAQs and Support Center:** Offer an in-app support center with frequently asked questions, troubleshooting guides, and a way to contact customer support for any issues or inquiries.
   - **User Feedback:** Allow users to provide feedback and suggestions directly through the app, fostering a sense of community and enabling continuous improvement.

5. **Accessibility:**
   - **Accessibility Features:** Ensure the game is accessible to a broad audience, including users with disabilities. Consider features like text-to-speech for in-game instructions and customizable controls.

By incorporating these features, the Tic-Tac-Toe Showdown Web App can not only offer a more intuitive user experience but also cater to a broader audience!

## Lessons Learned:

Mapping out the required functions, defining the necessary data structures, and initializing variables are crucial steps in the development process of a web application like the Tic-Tac-Toe Showdown. This ensured that the game starts in a predictable and consistent state, allowing for a smooth user experience. By planning these aspects well, I was able to set a solid foundation for the development process, making it easier to maintain, expand, and enhance the web application over time if needed!
